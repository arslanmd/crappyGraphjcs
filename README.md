# crappyGraphjcs
A software renderer based on 'tinyrenderer' by Dmitry V. Sokolov, which is an  OpenGL clone used for a
3D graphics course. I wanted to try and apply the things I learned, challenge myself to implement it in
Java (cuz I'm crazy), then extend it as an exercise in programming.

> Note: This project is written by a relative amateur, in a programming language that was not designed for extreme high-performance. Thus, it is quite unenjoyable to browse through.
